    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Since hand-made products have become very trendy, moreover, they are also eco-friendly, we think that this part will also serve as a message to convey. The products that are offered are made by women from every city of Albania, as some deep areas due to the impossibility, give a good hand in the economy, or many women who are part of different associations/organizations because they know how to make such products. The business will be supported by various non-profit organizations that deal with women's rights in Albania and do not have employment opportunities.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> The message is to give a different opportunity to people, especially women, who cannot live a normal life because of conditions that do not favor them and introduce the concept of environmental protection, because hand-made products are also made in such a way with products that are recycled and are eco-friendly. We also have the concept of reusable materials because these products are created under artisanal conditions and to reach for a good result, many things must be combined at the same time, and thus it is not necessarily useful to use things that are consumed for such time.</p>
